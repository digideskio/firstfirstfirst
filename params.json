{"name":"First first first","tagline":"All the things","body":"### First first first\r\nThe web/app universe has a lot to say about what to do first when re-building/re-designing or embarking on a new technical adventure. Turns out almost everybody is right. There are a number of things that need to be done first. You work in software development so you understand this double think norm. Yet when everything is urgent, nothing is (insert meme here). This means we can then relax and make a list.\r\n\r\n| First         | Why           |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\r\n| Readme First  | Fail first's little brother. Let your own documentation guide you. |\r\n| Fail First    | If you write them (tests), the code will come... out of sheer annoyance. |\r\n| Cloud First   | Nobody wants to be in the hosting business. |\r\n| Mobile First  | The classic that started it all. Phones are gonna be huge! |\r\n| Data First    | Think analysis early. Eventually you'll need what's going on. |\r\n| German First  | Say it with me: \"internationalization.\" It's a long word without a line break. |\r\n| Ugly First    | Your users don't necessary create the best things. Like German text. |\r\n| Personalization First | People want different things. You can't afford to be boring. |\r\n| Offline First | Mobile first's cousin. Stuff breaks. |\r\n\r\n### Helps.\r\nPlease help me write this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
